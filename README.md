# AcetoneChamber-ESP8266
A project for a home made acetone chamber, for smoothing ABS 3D prints, with heating and ventilation and a web based GUI.

This is a personal project for creating an acetone chamber for smoothing ABS prints. The idea is to use a controlled temperature environment with a specific cycle for heating.

# <mark> THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS </mark>
